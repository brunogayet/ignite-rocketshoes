# RocketShoes

In this challenge proposed by the company Rocketseat, we will create the RocketShoes, an application similar to an e-commerce to train various concepts in ReactJS.

This will be an application where the main objective is to create a shopping cart hook.

*This project is using Typescript*

Functionalities:
- Add a new product to the cart;
- Remove a product from the cart;
- Change the quantity of a product in the cart;
- Calculation of the sub-total and total cart prices;
- Inventory validation;
- Display of error messages;
- Among others.ðŸš€
